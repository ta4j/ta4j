## 0.22.1 (2026-01-15)

### Added
- **Manual GitHub Release workflow trigger**: Added `workflow_dispatch` support with a required tag input so maintainers can backfill or re-run a GitHub Release directly from the Actions UI.
- **GitHub Release dry-run option**: Added a `dryRun` flag for manual GitHub Release triggers to preview notes, validate artifacts, and preflight release token permissions without publishing.
- **Manual actionlint trigger**: Added `workflow_dispatch` support so workflow linting can be run on demand.

### Changed
- **GitHub Release execution path**: Release creation now relies on tag-push triggers (and the manual dispatch option) instead of being invoked directly from `release.yml`, with the workflow checking out the target tag to align notes and artifacts.
- **Release automation tokens**: `release-scheduler.yml` and `release.yml` use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, while `github-release.yml` uses the `GH_TA4J_REPO_TOKEN` classic PAT for GitHub Release creation under org token restrictions.

### Fixed
- **GitHub Release artifacts**: Build now uses the production-release profile so javadoc jars are generated and artifact validation succeeds.
- **GitHub Release asset uploads**: Removed overlapping upload patterns to prevent duplicate asset uploads from failing the release.
