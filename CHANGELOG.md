Changelog for `ta4j`, roughly following [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) from version 0.9 onwards.

## 0.10 (2017-10-30)

### VERY Important notes!!!!

- With the release 0.10 we have changed the previous java package definition to org.ta4j or to be more specific to org.ta4j.core (the new organisation). You have to reorganize all your refernces to the new packages!
In eclipse you can do this easily by selecting your sources and run "Organize imports" <br>
- **Changed ownership of the ta4j repository**: from mdeverdelhan/ta4j (stopped the maintenance) to ta4j/ta4j (new organization)

### Fixed
- **ParabolicSarIndicator**: wrong calculation fixed
- **KAMAIndicator**: stack overflow bug fixed
- **AroonUpIndicator and AroonDownIndicator**: wrong calculations fixed and can handle NaN values now

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: **new package structure** change eu.verdelhan.ta4j to org.ta4j.ta4j-core
- **new package adx**: new location of AverageDirectionalMovementIndicator and DMI+/DMI-
- **Ownership of the ta4j repository**: from mdeverdelhan/ta4j (stopped the maintenance) to ta4j/ta4j (new organization)
- **ParabolicSarIndicator**: old constructor removed (there was no need for time frame parameter after big fix). Three new constructors for default and custom parameters.
- **HighestValueIndicator and LowestValueIndicator:** ignore also NaN values if they are at the current index
