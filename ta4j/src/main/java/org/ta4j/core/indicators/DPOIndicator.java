/**
 * The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) indicator.
 * <p>
 * The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) is an indicator designed to remove trend
 * from price and make it easier to identify cycles. DPO does not extend to the
 * last date because it is based on a displaced moving average. However,
 * alignment with the most recent is not an issue because DPO is not a momentum
 * oscillator. Instead, DPO is used to identify cycles highs/lows and estimate
 * cycle length.
 *
 * In short, DPO(20) equals price 11 days ago less the 20-day SMA.
