# ta4j-core

`ta4j-core` contains the production API surface for strategy modeling, backtesting, analysis, and live-style record management.

## Start here

- Series model: `BarSeries`, `BaseBarSeries`, `ConcurrentBarSeries`
- Strategy model: `Indicator`, `Rule`, `Strategy`
- Execution model: `BarSeriesManager`, `BacktestExecutor`, `TradeExecutionModel`
- Trade/fill model: `TradingRecord`, `BaseTradingRecord`, `Trade`, `TradeFill`
- Analysis model: `AnalysisCriterion` and criteria packages

## Choose the right execution path

- Single strategy over one series: use `BarSeriesManager`
- Many candidates, tuning, weighted ranking: use `BacktestExecutor`
- Broker-confirmed/partial-fill replay: use manual evaluation loop + `BaseTradingRecord.operate(fill)`

## Live evaluation semantics (important)

- ta4j evaluates the bar state you provide at the requested index; it does not force closed-candle-only evaluation.
- If your feed uses `addBar(bar, true)` or equivalent replace-last-bar updates, you are evaluating a live (still-forming) candle.
- If you evaluate only after adding a completed bar, you are evaluating closed candles.
- For live execution, call `shouldEnter(index, tradingRecord)` / `shouldExit(index, tradingRecord)` and keep `tradingRecord` synchronized with broker-confirmed fills.
- Add an integration guard (for example, one entry per bar index) to avoid duplicate orders when a live candle keeps the same rule state across multiple updates.

## Trace rule decisions

- To answer "why did this fire?" or "why did this not fire?", enable SLF4J `TRACE` on the relevant `Rule` or `Strategy` logger and run the normal `isSatisfied(...)`, `shouldEnter(...)`, or `shouldExit(...)` call.
- TRACE logging is the off switch; there is no mutable trace mode to set on shared rule or strategy instances.
- Default trace output is `Rule.TraceMode.VERBOSE`, which emits the evaluated rule plus child-rule path/depth fields where a composite rule evaluates children.
- Use `Rule#isSatisfiedWithTraceMode(..., Rule.TraceMode.SUMMARY)` or `Strategy#shouldEnterWithTraceMode(...)` / `shouldExitWithTraceMode(...)` for a one-shot parent summary when child logs would be too noisy.
- Stop rules include flat `key=value` decision fields such as `currentPrice`, `entryPrice`, `stopPrice`, `side`, trailing extremes, and configured amount or percentage fields.

## Choose the right series type

- Single-threaded backtests and deterministic local runs: `BaseBarSeries`
- Concurrent ingestion/evaluation pipelines: `ConcurrentBarSeries`

## Choose the right numeric model

- Precision-first workflows: `DecimalNum`
- Throughput-first workflows with accepted floating-point tradeoffs: `DoubleNum`
