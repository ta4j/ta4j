/**
 * McGinley Moving Average (McGinleyMA) Indicator.
 *
 * The McGinley Moving Average is a technical analysis tool developed by John
 * McGinley to address issues with traditional moving averages such as lag and
 * responsiveness to market volatility. It is designed to adapt dynamically to
 * changing market conditions by incorporating a smoothing factor that adjusts
 * automatically based on the speed of price movement. This makes it less prone
 * to false signals and more reliable for identifying trends in both volatile
 * and stable markets.
