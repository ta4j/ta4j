 * Asymmetric Triangular Moving Average (ATMA) Indicator.

 * the Triangular Moving Average (TMA) the modified equation creates a smoother
 * and slightly lagged moving average compared to the traditional TMA. By
 * varying the smoothing lengths asymmetrically, it balances responsiveness to
 * initial price changes with reduced noise in the final result.
