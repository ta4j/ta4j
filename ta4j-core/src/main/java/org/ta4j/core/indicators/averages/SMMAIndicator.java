/**
 * Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) Indicator.
 *
 * Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) is a type of moving average that applies
 * exponential smoothing over a longer period. It is designed to emphasize the
 * overall trend by minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations. Unlike the
 * Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which assigns more weight to recent prices,
 * the SMMA evenly distributes the influence of older data while still applying
 * some smoothing.
