 * TMA is a double-smoothing of the Simple Moving Average (SMA).
 *
 * Triangular Moving Average (TMA) is a type of moving average that places
 * greater emphasis on the central portion of the data series. It is calculated
 * as a second smoothing of a Simple Moving Average (SMA), making it smoother
 * than the SMA or Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Due to its double-smoothing
 * nature, the TMA is commonly used to identify long-term trends in financial
 * markets, reducing noise from short-term fluctuations.
