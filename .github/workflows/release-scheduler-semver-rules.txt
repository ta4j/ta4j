MAJOR: Only when breaking API changes in core APIs.
MINOR: Backward-compatible new features.
PATCH: Backward-compatible bug fixes.

If diff empty or changelog-only should_release=false.
NEVER major without explicit breaking change evidence.

Version awareness: Consider the current version when determining the bump type.
If the current version is pre-1.0.0 (e.g., 0.x.y), the project is in beta/unstable phase.
Breaking changes in pre-1.0.0 versions are more acceptable and may only warrant a MINOR bump rather than MAJOR.
